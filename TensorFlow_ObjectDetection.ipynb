    "# ----------------- TensorFlow Models -----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains a number of different models implemented in TensorFlow, link https://github.com/tensorflow/models\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the Object detection API so we will need to install it and make it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Official release and info are located in *models/research/object_detection*, link https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection\n",
    "\n",
    "From the GitHub page we see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ----------------- Installing Tensorflow Object Detection API -----------------\n",
    "This page has the official release info https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly use this API we need to follow the installation instructions on https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also follow instructions in this video\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COlbP62-B-U, or this link https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-use-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install dependencies \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically we have TensorFlow and all the rest of the dependencies already, what is missing is the following:\n",
    "- lxml\n",
    "- image\n",
    "So open a CMD and type:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "pip install lxml\n",
    "pip install image\n",

    "### Download Protobuf and models\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding protobuf go to this page and get the corresponding version, link https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding models go to this page and download the reposotory, link https://github.com/tensorflow/models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protobuf Compilation\n",
    "Navigate to directory tensorflow/models/research/ and run the following from a CMD:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.\n",
    "```\n",
    "It didn't work ? are you getting errors? well sometimes it happens, basically here the CMD is not capabale of using the wild character * for some reason. A work around is to compile the proto files one by one... However if you are bored of doing that and want to automate the process then i wrote some python code for that. The code is called \n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Compiling_all_proto_files.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run it, ofcourse just edit the **files_path** and **cwd_**\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the setup files\n",
    "Although it is not mentioned, navigate to directory tensorflow/models/research/ open a CMD and type:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "python setup.py build\n",
    "python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",

    "people with issues for not doing this step see link https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/2031\n",
    "### Add Libraries to PYTHONPATH\n",
    "Although it is not mentioned, you still need to add the PYTHONPATH on windows, so do it by following thi link for instructions, link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-7\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically this is what you need to do, go to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables >\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then under system variables create a new Variable called **PythonPath**. In this variable include the following:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "C:\\Users\\XXX\\Desktop\\DL\\models;C:\\Users\\XXX\\Desktop\\DL\\models\\research;C:\\Users\\XXX\\Desktop\\DL\\models\\research\\slim\n",
    "```\n",
    "Obviously you need to point to where the **models**, **research** and **slim** folders are located. These are located in the downloaded the reposotory of https://github.com/tensorflow/models\n",

    "**Note:** you might need to restart the PC for this to take effect\n",
    "\n",
    "people with issues for not doing this step see link https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/2031\n",
    "### Testing the Installation\n",
    "Navigate to directory tensorflow/models/research/ open a CMD and type:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "python object_detection/builders/model_builder_test.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If for any reason you don't get any boundery boxes or get some faulty behaviour, than maybe the current model listed by the master branch is unstable, and this is the one you are using. To fix that just replace the model name so the it looks like this\n",
