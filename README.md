# SettingUpPython
This is for setting up scientific python without any other third party software

By third party software i mean Anaconda or similar. basically if you want to have full control over your installation of python and its packages. 

e.g. If there is a new version of tensorflow and you work in research and dont want to wait even if its a few days to start using that, then this would be beneficial

I still don't know if this is optimal, but it works fine for me, no problems and everything goes smoothly. Also i must admit i like to know where everything is and why...
