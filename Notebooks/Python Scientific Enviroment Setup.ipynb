    "\n",
    "## ----------------- Install scientific libraries -----------------\n",
    "By this point you should have numpy installed, so to install the rest type the following in the terminal:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "pip3 install --upgrade matplotlib\n",
    "pip3 install --upgrade pandas\n",
    "pip3 install --upgrade sympy\n",

    "#### Note but not important - Everything should work normally without this step\n",
    "\n",
    "Important wheel files i.e. .whl can be .zip .rar etc. they are archives when you download them, so if for any reason your wheel file is seen as rar or zip, then just change the extension to .whl instead, then pip install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise (not recommended although should work, but I didn’t try it), you can basically unzip the archive and then take the numpy folder and paste it in C:\\Users\\XXX\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35\\Lib\\site-packages\n",
